## Week 02 Question Set

a)  **What do you feel was the most impressive thing you did in class last week was?**

Setting up my workflow for a big project is always a crutial step, this cannot be understated. 

b)  **What is your weekly goal for making progress on your project? What is the next step?**

Gather Transcriptome link and add Count Matix (table) into geoduck manuscript

c)  **There were two readings this week not from the textbook, meant for two different audiences. Which reading did you get the most out of and why? Do you have any questions regarding the Journal of Shellfish Research paper?**

The MarineOmics paper was higher level with an amount of detail appropriate for Scientists about to run genomic analysis. Steven and Mac's paper in the Jounal of Shellfish Research is lower level--but stil appropriate for PhD level Scientists but who don't have previous experience with Marine Genomic tools. I really enjoyed Steven's paper because it had a very well written introduction and had a hopeful tone where you believe you can ecological research using functional genomics! 

d)  **What is your favorite thing about markdown and why?**

I love that formatting is all in the **code** and it makes nice equations when printed out. It can also generate plots and figures automatically without added images

e) **What is the differnce between `curl` and `wget`? When would you used one over the other?

Both are used to get information off the internet, wget only offers http support where curl is the more robust method of the two. I would use curl exclusively
