a)  **What is `tmux` and how does this relate to our current way of working on raven?**

- tmux is especially useful when working on remote desktops or servers because it allows users to detach from a session and reconnect to it later, even if the connection to the remote machine is lost.

b)  **What is `ssh` and what would the code be you would type if you were going to `ssh` into raven?**

- SSH is how you log into a remote desktop computer via the command line
- ssh olivia@raven.fish.washington.edu
- pw **************

c)  **What has been the most challenging part of your research project? Are you happy with your organization skills? If not what could be improved?**

- The most challenging part is making sure my blasting code is building the correct directory and runs without crashing in 7 seconds
- I could do a better job organizing my data in Mox and in Github. I have too many working directories and I find it cumpersom to transfer data between directories or repositories when I could be using that time to write code or write my papers. 



d)  **For last weeks assignment what did you appreciate the most about knitting documents?**
- it is super easy to include R ggplot2 graphs without dealing with png or pdf's that can look strange without knitting documenets.
