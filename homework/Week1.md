# What is your prior experience in this discipline?
- I've used this class repository to self teach blast and kallisto for my Master's Project

# What do you hope to get out of this class?
- To finish my geoduck transcriptome work and to better understand bioinformatics

# This class is strongly rooted in an independent project related to genomic analyses. What specific project do you have in mind? If you do not have any data or preference, data can be provided / aquired. If you do not have a specfic project, what approach would you like to master as part of this class?
- My independent project is going to be a comapirative transcriptome analysis of geoduck clam and other clam tissue types

# What are two things you found most useful from the reading?
- I always understood that we need to let computers do the work for us, but the chapter took it to the next level with Test Code, or Better Yet, Let Code Test Code! I think a potential point of error could be how and when to use units tests without taking too much time away from the project.
