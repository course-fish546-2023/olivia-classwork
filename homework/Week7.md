a)  **What is your current grade in the class? How many issues are open in our research repository?**
- Currently I have a 43.2% but that is because Steven has yet to grade any of my assignments which were done in the week assigned 
- Currently there are 23 issues still open in our class repository 

b)  **Re-reading this week's reading, what are 2 things that resonate with you now that made little practical sense in week 2. What is one aspect that you still wonder about or is unclear?**
- I hadn't yet processed BAM or SAM files when I first read "Opportunities in Functional Genomics: A Primer on Lab and Computational Aspects" and that section in the discussion made way more sense today than it did in week2. I've used FASTQC, Trinity, Kallisto, and IGV before for my research and in other genetics classes but I am still unfamiliar with sequence read mappping softwares such as Bowtie or Tophat.

c)  **What is epigenetics and how could it relate to your own research project?**
- epigenetics is the study of how the environment can effect how genes are transcribed without changing the underlying genetic code. Since I am working with genomes and transcriptomes, epigenetics covers how I will analyze the transcripts produced by the underlying genetic code of Panopea generosa. 

d)  **Describe what a GFF file is?**
-GFFa are tab delimited text files (general feature format) that stores genetic information such as chromosome number, type of data, start and end codon locations, score, forward or reverse direction, and more that pertain to genetic information primarily. 

e)  **What are two ways describing CG motifs could have value?**
- You can describe the CG motifs as either methylated or unmethlyated 
- You can describe the precence of CG motifis as a percentage of the overall cytosines...for example....In mammals, 70% to 80% of CpG cytosines are methylated.
