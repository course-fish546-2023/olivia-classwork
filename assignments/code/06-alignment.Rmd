#Introduction
This week, we will consider a different way of looking at the relatedness of genetic information: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs are used to describe population variation or phylogenetic relationships. A first step in this is aligning sequence reads to look for variation.


## SAM and BAM files
SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) are two file formats used to store aligned sequencing data. Both formats are designed to store read alignments from high-throughput sequencing experiments to a reference genome. 

## SAMtools
Samtools is a software package designed for manipulating and analyzing high-throughput sequencing data, specifically SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) files.
